## The Industry  
  
  
- Publisher's face print circulation decline as everyone reads on the web  
- Ad revenues for news sites are on a decline too as all the profits go to Google & Facebook  
- Paid content though disliked by the end users and still in its infancy is one of the   solutions

## The Trade-offs

- Entering paid content is a challenge for every news organisation
- The ad revenues are still substantial and losing it now may be too soon
- The revenues from a paywall are hard to estimate without any prior data
- New York Times succeeded, but most sites are not NYT

---

## The Solution

- While there are ways to quantify the potential gains and losses either internally or through an external company, not all publishers are willing to make that investment
- That's why we offer the first sanity check in form of this calculator
- If the numbers that come out are of interest then let's talk...
- If they aren't, well you just avoided wasting time, money and other resources you'd
otherwise need to find out the hard way

## Notes

- The Calculator is based on a regression model using data from many sites that already
have a paywall
- These are not the only factors that come into play, but it's a start...
- It's actually one of my projects at work!
